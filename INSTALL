1. Extract to your observium / librenms install directory html/ so you should see something like /opt/observium/html/weathermap/
	The best way to do this is via git. Go to your install directory and then html/.
	Enter:
		git clone https://github.com/laf/Weathermap-for-Observium.git weathermap
2. Edit map-poller.php and data-pick.php and make sure the variables at the start are all ok.
	**** Please ensure you set $pathd in map-poller.php correctly *****
3. Within editor.php, make sure you set $ENABLED=true and check the correct url for $weathermap_url;
4. Make the configs directory writeable by your web server, either chown apache:apache configs/ or chmod 777 configs (I'd highly advise you choose the first option, replace apache:apache with your web servers user and group.)
5. Point your browser to your install /weathermap/editor.php (i.e http://testurl.org/weathermap/editor.php)
6. Create your maps, please note when you create a MAP, please click Map Style, ensure Overlib is selected for HTML Style and click submit.
7. Make the map-poller.php executable by running chmod +x map-poller.php
8. Enable the cron process:
	Observium:
	*/5 * * * * /opt/observium/html/weathermap/map-poller.php >> /dev/null 2>&1

	LibreNMS:
	*/5 * * * * /opt/librenms/html/weathermap/map-poller.php >> /dev/null 2>&1

**** IMPORTANT SECURITY *****

It is highly recommended that you set $ENABLED=false in editor.php when you are not editing maps as this is accessible by anyone unless you secure it via .htaccess or your web server config.
